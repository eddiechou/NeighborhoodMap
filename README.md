# Neighborhood Map
#### Created by: Eddie Chou

This application uses Knockout.js as a framework to develop a single page application featuring a map of London with markers for a list of museums.

## Instructions
- Download the zip file.
- Unzip the file.
- Open index.html in a web browser.

## Description
The sidebar on the left lists the locations by name. You may filter the list (and associated markers) by using the filter field at the bottom of the list. You may toggle the sidebar by clicking the accordion at the top left of the screen. Clicking on the name of the museum or its associated marker will open up an infoBubble, which displays relevant information from Wikipedia and several images from Flickr about the museum.

APIs used: Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Foursquare.

Libraries used: Knockout, jQuery, infoBubble.
